4. (Under Documentation) i had alot of issues within this assignment setting up the github actions, it took me nights to try and get it to work and even when i got the actions setup the build/tests failed on github...

  another issue i had was trying to make it so that the fitnesstracker had more variety and examples to it, right now when you run it it currently gives the same results. I wanted to set it up sort of like a menu or multiple different users/workouts
  since i was not able to figure it out i left it as be considering it was not possible to be completed before the due date of Friday 11;59pm (02-07-2025)


   My Project The Fitness Tracker  is designed to help users track their fitness progress by logging different types of workouts and calculating how many calories they've burned during each session.
   It also lets users set a calorie burning goal and checks whether they've met it. If the goal is met, it congratulates the user; otherwise, it encourages them to keep going and reach their goal.


   This project uses dependencies like JUnit for testing, and the Maven build system for managing dependencies.
